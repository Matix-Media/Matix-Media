### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hi! I am Max, I come from Hamburg in Germany. I've been programming for about 5 years now. I do website, desktop and backend programming. Since I am currently still attending school, I am not hired by any company, and thus still free on the market :). I prefer to program websites and desktop applications. I've always been drawn to computers, these wonderful magic machines with all the flashing lights. That's probably why I started programming at the age of 10. If you have a question or just want to chat, just get in touch with me.

ðŸ”­ My biggest project is currently [MatixCDN](https://cdn.matix-media.net).

Have fun ðŸ˜„ðŸ¥³
